# Day 7

MBR (Master Boot Record) In our old laptops we have by default bios loaders which means we have MBR installed. Since new releases have by default UEFi installed.

## To list the disks attached in the system
Use the command ```lsblk``` to list the attached volumes

## To list detailed view of hard drives
Use the command ```fdisk -l``` to list detailed view of drives.

## Create ```new``` partition
The smallest thing in a hard disk is sector which is a size of 512bytes.
Now to create a new partition use the command ```new``` or ```n``` to create a new partition.

```
Command (m for help): n
Partition type:
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended
Select (default p):
```

## To create a primary partition in disk
By default we create a primary partition so in order to create a primary partition we have to press ```p``` in order to create a primary partition.
```
Select (default p): p
Partition number (1-4, default 1):
```
## To start the first sector we have to enter the block value by default we have to press ```enter```.
```
First sector (2048-4194303, default 2048):
Using default value 2048
```
## Now we have to give size or number of sectors
To give size we use ```+300M``` to create a 300MB partition in the drive
```
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-4194303, default 4194303): +300M
```
## Again we have to create 2 more primary partitions total 3 primary
```
Command (m for help): n
Partition type:
   p   primary (2 primary, 0 extended, 2 free)
   e   extended
Select (default p): p
Partition number (3,4, default 3):
First sector (1026048-4194303, default 1026048):
Using default value 1026048
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (1026048-4194303, default 4194303): +100M
Partition 3 of type Linux and of size 100 MiB is set
```
## Now we have to create the last partition as extended partition.

```
Command (m for help): n
Partition type:
   p   primary (3 primary, 0 extended, 1 free)
   e   extended
Select (default e):
Using default response e
Selected partition 4
First sector (1230848-4194303, default 1230848):
Using default value 1230848
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (1230848-4194303, default 4194303):
Using default value 4194303
Partition 4 of type Extended and of size 1.4 GiB is set
```

#### Note never ever delete or format extended partition because it contains all of your logical partitions.

## Now we will create our 1st logical partition.
```
Command (m for help): n
All primary partitions are in use
Adding logical partition 5
First sector (1232896-4194303, default 1232896):

## Now to save the partition system we have to use ```wq``` to save and exit the partition system
```
Command (m for help): wq
The partition table has been altered!

[root@ip-172-31-43-73 ~]#
```
#### Now we have created partitions now we need to format the partitions in order to make it understandable to Operating system
Formatting a system means making enviorment, when we format a drive it cleans the ```Inode``` table index, this doesn't means that we have deleted the data from the hard drive.

*   NTFS New technology file system. This is for Windows Users
*   HFS+ This is for Apple users.
*   XFS This is used for RedHat OS.
*   FAT / VFAT / eXFAT It is the common file system which works on all Operating Systems.

## To format a partition
When we need to format the partition with ```XFS``` for our redhat system. Therefore we use
```
[root@ip-172-31-43-73 ~]# mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf1
meta-data=/dev/xvdf1             isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=19200 blks
         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=0, sparse=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=76800, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=855, version=2
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
```
## To check how many format file systems are available in your system
Press ```mkfs.``` and press ```double Tab``` to get the available file systems in your system.

```
[root@ip-172-31-43-73 ~]# mkfs.
mkfs.btrfs   mkfs.cramfs  mkfs.ext2    mkfs.ext3    mkfs.ext4    mkfs.minix   mkfs.xfs
```
## Now we need to Mount our drive in order to use that.
When we mount a drive we basically create a folder and we map the partition with the folder. When we mount it assigns a icon to the folder which looks like a drive attached.

Basically mount means create a folder and map/link a partition.

#### To check the mounted disks we use the command ```df```.
```
[root@ip-172-31-43-73 ~]# df
Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda2      10473452 1802012   8671440  18% /
devtmpfs          484748       0    484748   0% /dev
tmpfs             506948       0    506948   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs             506948   13280    493668   3% /run
tmpfs             506948       0    506948   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs             101392       0    101392   0% /run/user/1000
tmpfs             101392       0    101392   0% /run/user/0
```
Now Create a folder in ```/mnt/drivename``` and then mount the partition. Check the exit code with ```echo $?```
```
[root@ip-172-31-43-73 mnt]# mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/mydrive300size/
[root@ip-172-31-43-73 mnt]# echo $?
0
```
#### In order to check the drive in human readable format use ```-h``` and with format ```-T```
```
[root@ip-172-31-43-73 mnt]# df -hT
Filesystem     Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda2     xfs        10G  1.8G  8.3G  18% /
devtmpfs       devtmpfs  474M     0  474M   0% /dev
tmpfs          tmpfs     496M     0  496M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs          tmpfs     496M   13M  483M   3% /run
tmpfs          tmpfs     496M     0  496M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs          tmpfs     100M     0  100M   0% /run/user/1000
tmpfs          tmpfs     100M     0  100M   0% /run/user/0
/dev/xvdf1     xfs       297M   16M  282M   6% /mnt/mydrive300size
```
#### Now we have mounted the partition but its icon is not visible. So if you need icon then create a folder in ```/media/partitionname``` insteed of ```/mnt/partitionname```.
Mounting a partition in media folder will automatically create a icon for that.

## Now we need to create permanent entry for mounting the drive.
There is a file in ```/etc/fstab``` which is used to automount the drive.
```
/dev/xvdf1 /mnt/mydrive300size XFS
```
## Client and Server Architecture
*   Server is a service provider which responds on a request generated by a client.
*   CLient is service reciever which request from server to get its response by server.
*   The server which serves web pages is called as web server.
*   The most popular web server on internet is Apache ```httpd``` and Apache ```apache2```
*   ```httpd``` works on every operating system.
*   ```apache2```  works on Ubuntu or linux systems.
*   NGINX is also a popular server. Example IRCTC Website works on NGINX
*   IIS is a specialized server which works best for Dot net based serves.
*   TOMCAT is a apache server which works best on JAVA based websites for streaming. It is specifically configured for JAVA websites.

## To check a software is installed on RedHat or not.
Use the command ```rpm -q package_name``` to check that the package is available or not.

## To check software configuration file of a package.
Use the command argument ```-c``` like ```rpm -qc package_name```
```
[root@ip-172-31-9-238 ~]# rpm -qc httpd
/etc/httpd/conf.d/autoindex.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.d/userdir.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-base.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-dav.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-lua.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-mpm.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-proxy.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-systemd.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/01-cgi.conf
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
/etc/httpd/conf/magic
/etc/logrotate.d/httpd
/etc/sysconfig/htcacheclean
/etc/sysconfig/httpd
```

## To start a service or check status of a service in redhat
Use the command ```systemctl start service_name```<br>
Use the command ```systemctl status service_name```
```
[root@ip-172-31-9-238 ~]# systemctl start httpd
[root@ip-172-31-9-238 ~]# systemctl status httpd

## Now we need to add the code of our html page.
*   So we have code in our github and we can clone that code in ```/var/www/html/```
*   Now by default we dont have git installed so install git ```yum install git```
*   Now clone the webpage you want and just use the folder path and run that.

## File Handling in Python
There are some operations we perform in file handling.
*   create
*   delete
*   rename
*   store
*   permission
*   Copy
*   Cut
*   blank

### Example code to search time functions in time liberary
```py
import time
x=[]
for i in dir(time):
    if 'time' in i:
        x.append(i)
```
```
y = [i for in dir(name) if 'time' in i]
```
```
import os
[j for j in dir(os) if 'dir' in j]
```
```
os.mkdir('hellololllloooo)
os.rmdir('ubfibjv)
```
```chdir``` it means ```cd```
```curdir``` it means ```pwd```
```chmod``` it means ```chmod```
```mkdir``` it means ```mkdir```

* To open a file we have a function ```open()```
```py
f = open('hello.txt','w')
```
*   To write a file we have a function ```write()``` in python call this will file handle.   
```
f = open('hello.txt','w')
f.write("Hello world this is file writer")
```
*   To close a file we have
```
f = open('hello.txt','w')
f.write("Hello world this is file writer")
f.close()
```
*   To apply both ```read``` and ```write``` operations we use ```w+``` 
*   When we write or read something python cursor shifts.
*   To fix this issue we have a function ```seek()``` this is used to get the curson position by entering the integer value of the position
*   To open a file in append mode use the mode ```a``` while opening the file.
    *   Since this is to add the data you cannot read the data.
*   To perform both read and write operations then use ```a+``` to perform read and write operations.
