# Day 31
*   To store data we use the most traditional and common way of using Databases.
*   We process raw data and process it and save to the database
*   In a SQL database we use tables which contains rigid rows and columns.
*   Static schema on write and read means we have fixed the schema when we planned to design the schema of a table.
*   If we want to add a column in a table we have to edit the schema in real time due to which while adding a new column all the users will be disconnected for a second or such.
*   To solve this issue of editing schema in real time we need a new type of system for this.
