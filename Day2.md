## Practice Session
So in today's class we have studies about shell.
```
cat /etc/shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
```
alias is used to create shortcuts<br>Note all these are temperory and will not be reflected changes in new terminal
```
alias d='date'
```
To make things permanent save everything in /home/$USER/.bashrc
```

```
