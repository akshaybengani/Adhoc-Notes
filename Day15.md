# Day 15 Cloud Computing
*   Compute means combining computation capabilities of CPU and RAM.
*   The computation power we dont have physically but we have a virtual computation power
## Categories of Cloud Computing
1.  SAAS
    *   Software As A Service
    *   Running Softwares and all  
2.  STAAS
    *   Storage As A Service
3.  PAAS
    *   It will give a enviorment to use a specific program or something, example If we want to use JAVA only then it will give only computation power for that particular thing.
4.  IAAS
    *   Infrastructure As A Service
5.  DBAAS
    *   Database As A Service
6.  NAAS
    *   Network As A Service

## Major Cloud Providers
*   AWS
    *   60% Market Share
    *   Postpaid Money Model
    *   150+ Services.
*   Azure
*   Google
*   OpenStack
*   IBM
*   Rackspace

## AWS Basic Information about EC2 Cloud
*   Hardware
    *   A physical resource which is a combination of RAM, CPU, HDD and Networking Equipments.
*   Hypervisor
    *   A program or a software which provides a service to host multiple operating systems on free hardware resources.
    *   Example VMWARE or VirtualBox.
    *   Hypervisors are of Two Types
        *   Type 1 Bare Metel Hypervisors
        *   Type 2 Hosted Hypervisors like VMware or Virtualbox.
    *   Type 2 Hypervisors are dependent upon the base Operating system.
    *   Type 1 Hypervisors are installed directly on Hardware which dont need an operating system to run on.
    * There are a lot of companies which develop Hypervisors like VmWare which develop both the types of hypervisors.
    *   Citrix is the 2nd largest Hypervisor development company.
        *   Type 1 Hypervisor named as XEN Server
        *   Type 2 Hypervisor named as XEN
    *   Redhat is the 3rd largest Hypervisor Development company.
        *   Type 1 Hypervisor named as RHEVH
        *   Type 2 Hypervisor named as KVM
    *   Micorsoft is the 4th largest Hypervisor development company.
        *   Type 1 Hypervisor named as Hyper-V
        *   Type 2 Hypervisor named as VirtualPC
    *   Oracle is the 5th largest Hypervisor development company.
        *   Type 1 Hypervisor named as VM
        *   Type 2 Hypervisor named as VirtualBox
    *   In maximum cases we will be using Type 1 Hypervisors.
    *   AWS uses Citrix XEN Server
*   Racks | Clusturs | Data Centers | Region
    *   It is a collections of Motherboard(RAM and CPU) placed together in a group of stack.
    *   NOTE: It dosent contain any HDD or SSD in computation Racks.
    *  A physical place of combination of Racks is called a Clustur.
    *   Collection of thousands of Clusturs is called as Data Center
    *   Collection of Multiple Data Centers in a city is called as Region.
*   EC2 Basics
    *   AWS uses a name Availability Zone for Region
    *   The combination of RAM and CPU in AWS is called as ECU (Elastic Compute Unit)
    *   When we ask for Storage is gives from EBS(Elastic Block Storage)
    *   AMI (Amazon Machine Image) These are the operating system images which Amazon provide us.
    *   VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) It gives us Networking Interface and Firewall Configuration.
    *   Boot Straping in EC2 to plan something for automation like something installation or host a website or such.
    

## Tasks
*   How many instance we can launch in a single shot in AWS
*   What is Request Spot Instance
*   Can we change Subnet Availability Zone after instance Launch.
*
