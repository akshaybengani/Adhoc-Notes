# DAY 33
Steps of creating a neural network
*   Data
*   Remove Unwanted Data
*   Label encoder
*   Dummy Variables
*   Testing and Training Data
*   Feature Scaling
*   ANN
*   Input in neural network
*   Weights in neural network
## EPOCH
*   It is the number of how many times the neural network will run in loop.
*   If the neural network gets 100% accuracy which is generally not happens, then the neural network will fail.
*   When the ouput is not totally accurate after the number of EPOCH then it will take the output of the last EPOCH result.
## Rules Tips
*   Whenever we have to deal with neural networks we must need to apply feature scaling to the dataset.
